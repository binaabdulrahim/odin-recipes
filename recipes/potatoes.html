		<h1>Air Fryer Smashed Potatoes</h1>
		<img src="../images/potatoes.jpg" alt="Potatoes Picture">
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>8 ounces baby gold potatoes </li>
			<li>1 tablespoon melted unsalted butter</li>
			<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
			<li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
			<li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
			<li>Â¾ teaspoon salt</li>	
			<li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
			<li>chopped fresh parsley for garnish</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
			<li>Meanwhile, place potatoes in a microwave-safe bowl: cook on high until just tender, about 5 minutes.</li>
			<li>Transfer potatoes to a baking sheet and use the bottom of a small glass to gently "smash" them to 3/4 or 1/2-inch thick. The thinner you flatten the potatoes, the crispier they will be.
			</li>
			<li>Brush melted butter over the tops of smashed potatoes. Season with salt, garlic powder, and pepper.</li>
			<li>Place potatoes in the basket of the air fryer in an even layer; cook until golden and crisp, about 10 minutes. Garnish with parsley and serve hot.</li>
		</ol>
